There are two playbooks in this example:

1. Creates a volume and installs operating system and arcgisserver to it

2. Boots a new machine from volume created in step 1 and runs an arcpy script on it. Afterwards the machine gets deleted but volume is stored for further use.

Before running the playbooks you need to have following things in order:

1. You need to have access to linux machine on which you have installed python, openstack-client, ansible and shade. Instructions how to install these: https://research.csc.fi/pouta-install-client

2. You need to have set up a pouta project with key-pairs and security groups to make connecting from your local machine possible. Instructions: https://research.csc.fi/pouta-getting-started

3. You need to have sourced the OpenStack RC file during your current  (section 3.4.1.3 Configure your terminal environment for OpenStack in https://research.csc.fi/pouta-install-client)

4. To install ArcGISServer you will need a provisioning file. Contact your University's contact person or giscoord@csc.fi

5. You will need to make some adjustments to playbooks such as names for keys and security groups you created and name of the arcpy script you want to run.
