Examples for doing spatial analysis with **Python** in CSC computing environment:
* `focal_mean` - Calculating focal mean with `rasterio`, also in paralellel with `multiprocessing`. Includes examples for different job types in Taito: simple serial, array and parallel. 
* `zonal_stats` - Calculating zonals statistics of a large raster dataset using virtual rasters on multiple cores with `rasterstats` and `multiprocessing`.
